 * Defines the Component paths used for every component within a form. This allows for

 * defined as follows.
 *
 *  - Form Path: The path to a component within the Form JSON. This path is used to locate a component provided a nested Form JSON object.
 *  - Data Path: The path to the data value of a component within the data model for the form. This path is used to provide the value path provided the Submission JSON object.
 *
 * These paths can also be broken into two different path "types".   Local and Full paths.
 *
 *  - Local Path: This is the path relative to the "current" form. This is used inside of a nested form to identify components and values relative to the current form in context.
 *  - Full Path: This is the path that is absolute to the root form object. Any nested form paths will include the parent form path as part of the value for the provided path.
